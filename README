## SETUP

- Run Postgres and Redis
``` docker compose up -d ```

- Start backend service
```
cd server
npm run start:dev
```

- Start frontend client (_on another terminal_)

```

## NOTES

- e2e tests using playwright to garantee integration between frontend and backend
- backend tests using @nestjs/testing which uses Jest under the hood
